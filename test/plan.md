# AI Desktop Agent - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
An AI desktop agent activated by a hotkey (Ctrl+Space), capable of understanding voice commands, interacting with the local operating system, browsing the web, and providing natural voice feedback.

## Personalization
- Address the user as "Boss" (Sahi)
- Use a natural female voice for responses
- Remember user preferences and interaction history
- Adapt to user habits over time

## Tech Stack
- **Core Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Virtual Environment**: venv
- **Hotkey Detection**: pynput or keyboard
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**:
  - SpeechRecognition with Google Web Speech API (initial implementation)
  - Optional: vosk or openai-whisper for offline capability
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:
  - edge-tts for natural female voice
  - pyttsx3 as fallback
- **LLM Interaction**:
  - tgpt CLI tool via subprocess
  - Optional: API-based alternatives if needed
- **Filesystem Interaction**: os, shutil
- **Application Control**: subprocess, pyautogui
- **Web Automation**: selenium or requests with BeautifulSoup4
- **Configuration & Memory**: JSON, SQLite

## Implementation Phases

## Key Components

### User Profile System
JSON-based profile storage tracking:
- User name and preferred address
- Voice preferences
- Frequently used applications
- Common search queries
- Interaction history

### Voice Interface
- Hotkey activation
- Natural voice output with edge-tts
- Clear audio input with error recovery
- Contextual and personalized responses

### Command System
- LLM-based intent parsing
- Modular command handlers
- Security-first approach to system operations
- Feedback on command execution

### Memory System
- Short-term session context
- Long-term preference tracking
- Pattern recognition for proactive assistance

## Security Considerations
- Strict validation for all system operations
- Limited scope of actions
- User confirmation for sensitive operations
- No arbitrary code execution
