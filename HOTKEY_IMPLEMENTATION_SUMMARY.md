# Hotkey Implementation Summary

## Overview
The hotkey functionality has been **FIXED** and **ENHANCED** with two distinct modes:

### 1. **ONE-SHOT MODE** (Hotkey Activation)
- **Trigger**: Press the `*` (asterisk) key
- **Behavior**: 
  - Listens for ONE command only
  - Executes the command
  - If follow-up is needed, handles it but then ends conversation
  - Does NOT continue listening for additional commands
  - Perfect for quick, single tasks

### 2. **CONTINUOUS MODE** (Dashboard/Tray Menu Activation)
- **Trigger**: 
  - Use tray menu "Start Conversation"
  - Click "Start Voice" in web dashboard
  - Use API endpoint `/api/voice/start-listening`
- **Behavior**:
  - Starts a continuous conversation
  - Asks follow-up questions
  - Continues listening until explicitly stopped
  - Normal conversational flow

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Hotkey Listener Not Starting
- **Problem**: Tray app wasn't starting the hotkey listener
- **Solution**: Added proper hotkey listener initialization in both `aiden_tray.py` and `tray_app.py`
- **Code**: Added `start_hotkey_listener()` method and integration with dashboard

### 2. Missing One-Shot Functionality
- **Problem**: All activations used the same continuous conversation mode
- **Solution**: Created separate activation methods:
  - `_on_hotkey_activated_oneshot()` - for hotkey presses
  - `_on_hotkey_activated()` - for tray menu/dashboard
- **Implementation**: Added mode flags (`hotkey_mode`, `dashboard_mode`) to track activation type

### 3. Conversation Flow Control
- **Problem**: No way to limit conversation to one command
- **Solution**: Modified `_process_message_common()` to check `hotkey_mode` and end conversation after command execution

## Files Modified

### 1. `aiden_tray.py` (Main Implementation)
- Added hotkey listener initialization
- Implemented `_on_hotkey_activated()` for one-shot mode
- Added proper dashboard integration
- Enhanced error handling and notifications

### 2. `tray_app.py` (Backup Implementation)
- Same enhancements as `aiden_tray.py`
- Consistent functionality across both tray apps

### 3. `src/dashboard_backend.py` (Core Logic)
- Added `hotkey_mode` and `dashboard_mode` flags
- Implemented `_on_hotkey_activated_oneshot()` method
- Added `_start_voice_interaction_oneshot()` for one-shot conversations
- Modified `_process_message_common()` to handle different modes
- Updated socket handlers and API routes to set correct modes

## How to Use

### For One Command (Hotkey)
1. Press `*` key anywhere in Windows
2. Speak your command when you hear the ready sound
3. Aiden executes the command and stops listening
4. Perfect for: "What time is it?", "Open Chrome", "Set fan to 50%"

### For Conversation (Tray/Dashboard)
1. Right-click tray icon → "Start Conversation", OR
2. Open dashboard → Click "Start Voice", OR
3. Use API endpoint
4. Have a full conversation with follow-ups
5. Say "bye", "stop", or "quit" to end

## Technical Details

### Mode Flags
```python
self.hotkey_mode = True   # One-shot mode active
self.dashboard_mode = True # Continuous mode active
```

### Key Methods
- `_on_hotkey_activated_oneshot()` - Hotkey press handler
- `_start_voice_interaction_oneshot()` - One-shot conversation
- `_process_message_common()` - Mode-aware message processing

### Mode Detection in Processing
```python
if self.hotkey_mode:
    # Always end after processing command
    self.conversation_active = False
elif self.dashboard_mode:
    # Continue conversation, ask follow-ups
    # Normal conversation flow
```

## Testing

### Automated Test
```bash
python test_hotkey_oneshot.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. **One-Shot Mode**: 
   - Run `python aiden_tray.py`
   - Press `*` key
   - Give one command
   - Verify it stops listening after response

2. **Continuous Mode**:
   - Use tray menu "Start Conversation"
   - Have a multi-turn conversation
   - Verify it continues listening

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Quick commands via hotkey don't start long conversations
2. **Flexibility**: Choice between quick tasks and full conversations  
3. **User Experience**: Intuitive - hotkey for quick, menu for conversation
4. **Battery Saving**: One-shot mode reduces microphone usage
5. **Context Appropriate**: Different modes for different use cases

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Hotkey functionality fixed
- ✅ One-shot mode implemented  
- ✅ Continuous mode preserved
- ✅ Mode detection working
- ✅ Both tray apps updated
- ✅ Dashboard integration complete
- ✅ Testing successful

The assistant now behaves exactly as requested:
- **Hotkey activation** = One command only
- **Dashboard/tray activation** = Full conversation mode
