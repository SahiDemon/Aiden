# üöÄ Smart Scheduled System Commands

Aiden AI now features a comprehensive **Smart Scheduled System Commands** system that allows users to schedule, modify, and abort system operations with intelligent verification and safety measures.

## ‚ú® Features

### üïê **Scheduled Commands**
- **Shutdown**: "shutdown in 10 minutes", "turn off computer in 1 hour"
- **Restart**: "restart in 5 minutes", "reboot in 30 minutes" 
- **Sleep**: "sleep in 15 minutes", "put computer to sleep in 2 hours"
- **Hibernate**: "hibernate in 45 minutes"
- **Lock Screen**: "lock computer in 5 minutes"

### üõ°Ô∏è **Smart Verification System**
- **Dangerous Commands**: Shutdown and restart always require user confirmation
- **Safe Commands**: Lock and sleep execute immediately or with minimal verification
- **Time-based Scheduling**: Any command with time gets special verification workflow
- **One-shot Mode Compatible**: Even in one-shot mode, dangerous commands ask for confirmation

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Modification**
- **Change Time**: "change to 20 minutes", "make it 1 hour instead"
- **Real-time Updates**: Modify active schedules without canceling and recreating
- **Flexible Parsing**: Supports "minutes", "mins", "hours", "hrs", "seconds", "secs"

### ‚ùå **Abort Capabilities**
- **Cancel Specific**: "cancel shutdown", "abort restart"
- **Cancel All**: "cancel all schedules", "abort everything"
- **Smart Detection**: Recognizes abort requests even in natural language

### üìä **Dashboard Integration**
- **Live Countdown Timers**: Real-time countdown display
- **Visual Urgency Indicators**: Color-coded urgency (normal/warning/urgent)
- **Interactive Controls**: Modify and cancel buttons for each schedule
- **Status Overview**: Shows all active schedules at a glance

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Scheduling
```
User: "Shutdown the computer in 10 minutes"
AI: "I'll turn off the PC in 10 minutes. Is that correct? You can say 'yes' to confirm, 'change to X minutes' to modify the time, or 'cancel' to abort."

User: "Yes"
AI: "Scheduled! I'll shutdown the system in 10 minutes. You can say 'cancel shutdown' or 'abort schedule' to stop it."
```

### Time Modification
```
User: "Shutdown in 10 minutes"
AI: "I'll turn off the PC in 10 minutes. Is that correct?"

User: "Change to 20 minutes"
AI: "Updated! Changed shutdown time from 10 minutes to 20 minutes."
```

### Abort Operations
```
User: "Cancel shutdown"
AI: "Cancelled shutdown schedule."

User: "Cancel all schedules"  
AI: "Cancelled all schedules: shutdown, restart."
```

### Immediate Commands with Verification
```
User: "Shutdown computer"
AI: "Are you sure you want to shutdown the computer right now? Say 'yes' to confirm or 'cancel' to abort."

User: "Yes"
AI: "Shutting down the computer."
```

```

## üìã Supported Command Patterns

### Time Expressions
- **Minutes**: "in 10 minutes", "in 5 mins", "after 30 minutes"
- **Hours**: "in 1 hour", "in 2 hrs", "after 3 hours"
- **Seconds**: "in 30 seconds", "in 45 secs"

### Operations
- **Shutdown**: "shutdown", "power off", "turn off computer"
- **Restart**: "restart", "reboot"
- **Sleep**: "sleep", "put to sleep"
- **Hibernate**: "hibernate"
- **Lock**: "lock", "lock screen", "lock computer"

### Modifications
- **Time Changes**: "change to X", "make it X", "update to X"
- **Cancel Operations**: "cancel", "abort", "stop", "never mind"

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### 1. **Verification Levels**
- **High Risk** (Shutdown/Restart): Always require explicit confirmation
- **Medium Risk** (Sleep/Hibernate): Confirm for scheduled, immediate for direct
- **Low Risk** (Lock): Minimal verification, immediate execution

### 2. **Time Thresholds**
- **Immediate**: < 1 minute (extra verification)
- **Warning**: 1-5 minutes (visual indicators)
- **Normal**: > 5 minutes (standard flow)

### 3. **Abort Mechanisms**
- **Voice Commands**: "cancel shutdown", "abort schedule"
- **Dashboard Buttons**: Interactive cancel controls
- **Emergency Stop**: "cancel all" stops everything

### 4. **Error Handling**
- **Failed Execution**: Graceful error reporting
- **Invalid Times**: Clear error messages
- **Network Issues**: Local fallback mechanisms

```

### 2. **Conflicting Schedules**
```
User: "Shutdown in 10 minutes" (while restart in 5 minutes is active)
AI: "You already have a restart scheduled in 5 minutes. Should I cancel that and schedule shutdown instead?"
```

### 3. **System Execution Failures**
```
Schedule executes but PowerShell command fails
‚Üí Logs error, notifies user, removes from active schedules
```

### 4. **Network/Dashboard Issues**
```
Dashboard disconnected during active schedule
‚Üí Schedule continues executing, reconnection shows current state
```
